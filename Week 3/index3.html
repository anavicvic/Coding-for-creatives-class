	<h2> In my free time...</h2>
	<p>I love <strong>travelling</strong>, so that's why I decided to do some quarters away. Meeting new people and new cultures enriches my soul. <br>
		And it blends with my <strong>drawing hobby</strong>. Sometimes I just sit in a bench and draw what I see, generally people.</p>

	<h2>Yeah, I like this kind of things</h2>
